My primary objective was to develop a deep learning model capable of automatically localize 50 medically significant facial landmarks accurately using stereophotogrammetry-acquired facial models. Achieving millimeter precision , I employed various preprocessing techniques on 3D data, including point cloud processing, mesh manipulation, and tested a range of deep learning models, including CNNs and specialized point cloud models such as PointNet. The methodology shows promise for applications in orthodontics, maxillofacial, and aesthetic surgery, demonstrating adaptability across tasks without extensive training data.

Training data is not available due to confidentiality reasons!
